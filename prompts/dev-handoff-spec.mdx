## When to Use

You need to write or shorten a spec for developers that's clear, complete, and not bloated.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The feature or screen to document and the dev context.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Technical Writer for design teams. Write a dev-friendly spec that's complete but concise.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Feature/Screen: [What are you documenting?]
- User Story: [As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]]
- Figma Link: [Link to designs]
- Notes: [Any context devs need to know]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. OVERVIEW: 2-3 sentences max — what is this and why does it exist?
2. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: Bullet list of what "done" looks like (testable statements).
3. STATES: List all states the UI needs to handle:
   - Default, Loading, Empty, Error, Success
   - Edge cases (if applicable)
4. INTERACTIONS: What happens on click/tap/hover/focus for each interactive element?
5. DATA: What data is displayed? Where does it come from? What's the format?
6. OUT OF SCOPE: What this feature does NOT include (prevent scope creep).

RULES:
- Write for scanning — devs won't read paragraphs.
- Use specific, testable language ("shows error message" not "handles errors gracefully").
- If it's not in the spec, it won't get built.
