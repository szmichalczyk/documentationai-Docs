## When to Use

You're handing off a design to developers and need to write clear specs without missing details.

## Requirements

Screen description or Figma link with all states and interactions to document.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Technical Design Specifier. Generate a developer handoff specification for this screen.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Screen Name: [e.g., "User Profile Settings"]
- Figma Link: [Optional]
- Description: [What does this screen do?]
- States: [List all states: default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading, empty]
- Interactions: [List all interactions: clicks, swipes, animations]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
Generate a spec covering:
1. COMPONENT BREAKDOWN: List every UI component on the screen with:
   - Component name
   - States it can be in
   - Data it displays (and source)
2. INTERACTION SPEC: For each interactive element:
   - Trigger (click, hover, etc.)
   - Behavior (what happens)
   - Animation (if any, with duration)
3. DATA REQUIREMENTS:
   - What API endpoints are needed?
   - What data fields are required?
   - What happens if data is missing?
4. EDGE CASES: What should devs handle that isn't obvious from the design?
5. RESPONSIVE NOTES: Any breakpoint-specific behavior?
6. ACCESSIBILITY: Key a11y requirements (focus states, ARIA labels, etc.)

RULES:
- Be specific. "Button turns blue" is better than "button changes color."
- Include timing for animations (e.g., "200ms ease-in-out").
- If something isn't designed yet, flag it clearly.
