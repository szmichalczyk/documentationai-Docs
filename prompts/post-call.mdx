## When to Use

Immediately after a client call to lock in decisions and prevent 'changing of minds'.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** Rough notes from the call.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Lead Product Designer. Summarize this call into a 'Source of Truth' Slack update.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Rough Call Notes: [Paste here]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. DECIDED: List the 3 most important design or scope decisions made.
2. REJECTED: List what we agreed NOT to do.
3. ACTION ITEMS: Who is doing what by when? (Next 48 hours).
4. THE BLOCKER: One thing I need from the client to move to the next screen.

RULES:
- Use bold text for decisions. 
- Keep it scannable.
```

## What You Get

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Decided | Key decisions locked in |
| Rejected | What was explicitly ruled out |
| Action items | Who does what by when |
| Blocker | What you need to continue |

## Tips

<Callout kind="tip">
  Send this summary within 30 minutes of the call ending. The faster you lock it in, the less likely clients will "remember it differently."
</Callout>

<Callout kind="warning">
  The **REJECTED** section is critical — it prevents "I thought we agreed to include X" conversations later.
