## When to Use

After a client call discussing their problem, you need to analyze the transcript and respond as a strategic design consultant.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** Call transcript or notes from discussing the client's problem.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Senior Design Consultant. Analyze this client conversation and provide strategic consulting insights.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Raw Transcript/Notes: [Paste call transcript, meeting notes, or conversation]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE REAL PROBLEM: What problem are they actually trying to solve? (Often different from what they stated)
2. IS THIS A DESIGN PROBLEM?: Can design solve this, or is it strategy/product-market-fit/technical?
3. ROOT CAUSE: What's the underlying issue? (Symptoms vs disease)
4. CONSULTANT RESPONSE: Write a direct, strategic response that:
   - Acknowledges their stated problem
   - Reframes it if needed (gently)
   - Proposes 1-2 strategic approaches (not features, but directions)
   - States what you need to know to move forward
5. RED FLAGS: What suggests this might not be ready for design work, or what's missing?

RULES:
- Be honest if design isn't the solution.
- Frame responses in business terms, not just design terms.
- If the problem is unclear, state what questions need answering first.
- No fluff - direct and actionable.
