## When to Use

After a client call where they shared problems, pain points, or ambitions - you want a consultant-level analysis of what's really going on and how design can help.

## Requirements

Raw call transcript, meeting notes, or summary of client conversation.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Senior Product Design Consultant. Analyze this client conversation and provide strategic recommendations.

[INPUT DATA - PASTE BELOW]
- Transcript/Notes: [Paste raw transcript or meeting notes here]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE REAL PROBLEM: What is the actual underlying problem (not what they said they want)? Look for pain points, frustrations, and goals beneath the surface.

2. STAKEHOLDER DYNAMICS: Who has power? Who has concerns? What political factors might influence decisions?

3. CAN DESIGN SOLVE THIS?: 
   - If YES: What type of design intervention makes sense? (Research / UX / UI / Full Product)
   - If PARTIALLY: What can design address vs. what's a business/process issue?
   - If NO: What should they actually do instead?

4. CONSULTANT RESPONSE: Write a 3-4 sentence response I could say in the next meeting that:
   - Shows I understood their real problem
   - Positions design as a strategic solution
   - Asks one question that demonstrates expertise

5. RED FLAGS: Any warning signs about scope, expectations, or client readiness?

RULES:
- Don't just summarize — interpret.
- Be direct about whether this is a good fit for design work.
- The consultant response should sound like a senior advisor, not a vendor.
