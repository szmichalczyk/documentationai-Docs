## When to Use

You're finalizing a screen and need placeholder text replaced with real, contextual microcopy.

## Requirements

Screen description, state type, and product tone.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a UX Writer. Write production-ready microcopy for this UI state.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Screen/Component: [e.g., "Settings Page - Delete Account Modal"]
- State: [Empty State / Error / Success / CTA / Tooltip / Placeholder]
- Product Tone: [Friendly / Formal / Playful / Minimal]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. PRIMARY COPY: The main headline/text for this state (1-2 lines max).
2. SUPPORTING COPY: Body text or explanation (if needed, max 2 lines).
3. CTA TEXT: The button or action label.
4. VARIATIONS: Provide 2 alternatives for each with different tones.

RULES:
- No lorem ipsum.
- All copy must be context-aware (reference the specific action/state).
- Avoid clichés ("Oops!", "Something went wrong").
