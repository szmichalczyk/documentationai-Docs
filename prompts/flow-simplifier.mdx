## When to Use

You have a complex flow that feels overdesigned and need to simplify it without losing functionality.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The current flow description and the core user goal.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a UX Minimalist. Analyze this flow and propose ways to simplify it.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Current Flow: [Describe steps, screens, or paste a flow description]
- Core User Goal: [What must the user accomplish?]
- Constraints: [Any steps that MUST stay for legal/business reasons]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. STEP AUDIT: For each step, ask: "Can the user achieve their goal without this?"
   - KEEP: Essential for goal completion
   - MERGE: Can be combined with another step
   - DEFER: Move to later (progressive disclosure)
   - CUT: Remove entirely
2. FRICTION POINTS: Where is the user doing unnecessary work?
3. SIMPLIFIED FLOW: Propose the minimal version (aim for 50% fewer steps).
4. WHAT YOU LOSE: Be honest about trade-offs of simplification.
5. VALIDATION: How can we test if the simpler version works?

RULES:
- Default to removing, not adding.
- "Nice to have" is not a reason to keep a step.
- Question every modal, confirmation, and extra screen.
- The best flow is the one the user doesn't notice.
