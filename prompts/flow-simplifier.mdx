## When to Use

You have a flow that feels too long or complicated and want AI to challenge unnecessary steps.

## Requirements

Current flow steps and user goal.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a UX Optimization Specialist. Challenge this flow and find ways to simplify it.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- User Goal: [What is the user trying to accomplish?]
- Current Flow: [List the current steps, numbered]
- Constraints: [Any steps that CANNOT be removed? e.g., Legal requirements]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. FRICTION AUDIT: For each step, ask: Is this necessary for the user's goal?
   - Mark as: ESSENTIAL / QUESTIONABLE / REMOVABLE
2. SIMPLIFICATION OPTIONS:
   - Quick Win: What can be removed with no negative impact?
   - Smart Default: What steps can be auto-filled or skipped with defaults?
   - Progressive Disclosure: What can be moved to "advanced" or shown later?
   - Merge: Which steps can be combined into one screen?
3. RADICAL OPTION: What if we cut the flow by 50%? What would break?
4. RECOMMENDED FLOW: The simplified flow with reasoning.

RULES:
- Challenge every step. "We've always done it this way" is not a reason.
- Consider: What if the user is on mobile? In a hurry?
- Removing friction is not the same as removing features.
