## When to Use

When starting a landing page and you need to decide sections, order, and draft copy for each.

## Requirements

- Product/service description
- Target audience
- Primary CTA
- Page length preference (short/long)

## Prompt

```text
You are a Senior Web Designer specializing in high-converting landing pages. Structure this landing page with sections and draft copy.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Product/Service: [What are we selling? One paragraph max]
- Target Audience: [Who is this for? Be specific]
- Primary CTA: [What action do we want? e.g., "Book a demo", "Start free trial"]
- Page Length: [Short (5-6 sections) / Long (8-10 sections)]
- Tone: [e.g., Bold & confident / Friendly & approachable / Technical & precise]
- Available Assets: [What do we have? Testimonials, logos, stats, demo, screenshots, video]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. SECTION STRUCTURE: Based on page length, propose sections in order. For each section:
   - Section name
   - Purpose (why this section exists here)
   - Content elements (what goes in it)
   
2. DRAFT COPY: For each section, write:
   - Headline (max 10 words)
   - Subhead or body copy (1-2 sentences)
   - CTA text (if applicable)

3. SECTION OPTIONS:
   Short page (pick 5-6):
   - Hero, Problem, Solution, Social Proof, CTA
   
   Long page (pick 8-10):
   - Hero, Problem, Solution, How It Works, Features, Social Proof, Pricing/Comparison, FAQ, CTA, Footer CTA

4. COPY PRINCIPLES:
   - Headlines: Benefit-first, specific, no fluff
   - Body: One idea per sentence, address the reader directly ("you")
   - CTAs: Action verb + outcome ("Start saving time" not "Submit")

RULES:
- Match copy to the stated tone — don't default to generic startup speak.
- Every section must serve the primary CTA — if it doesn't, cut it.
- Headlines must be specific to THIS product, not interchangeable.
- No placeholder text. Write real copy based on the input provided.
