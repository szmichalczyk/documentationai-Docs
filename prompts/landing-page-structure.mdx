## The Trigger

When creating first drafts of landing page structure — deciding what sections to include, in what order, and what content each needs.

## Requirements

- The product/service being promoted
- Target audience
- Available assets (testimonials, logos, stats, demo)

## Prompt

```text
You are a Conversion-Focused Web Designer. Structure this landing page for maximum conversion.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Product/Service: [What are we selling?]
- Target Audience: [Who is this for?]
- Primary CTA: [What action do we want them to take?]
- Key Differentiator: [Why choose this over alternatives?]
- Available Assets: [Testimonials, logos, stats, demo, etc.]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. PAGE GOAL: Define the ONE action we want visitors to take.
2. HERO SECTION: Headline (benefit), subhead (how), CTA, visual recommendation, trust signal.
3. PROBLEM/PAIN: What pain point does the audience have? How do we agitate it?
4. SOLUTION: 3-4 steps or features max — outcomes, not mechanics.
5. SOCIAL PROOF: Which type fits best? (Testimonials, logos, stats, case study)
6. OBJECTION HANDLING: What might stop them? FAQ or inline reassurances.
7. FINAL CTA: Repeat primary action with risk reversal.
8. SECTION PRIORITY: Mark which sections are MVP vs. nice-to-have.

RULES:
- Every section must earn its place — if it doesn't move toward CTA, cut it.
- Mobile-first: Structure should work in single-column.
- One page, one goal — don't dilute with multiple CTAs.
- Prefer visuals/demos over text walls.
```

## Example Output

### Page Goal
Primary CTA: Start free trial

### Hero Section
- **Headline**: "Ship your MVP in 2 weeks, not 2 months"
- **Subhead**: "We design and build products for YC startups"
- **CTA**: "Book a call"
- **Visual**: Product mockup or founder video
- **Trust signal**: "Trusted by 50+ YC companies"

### Problem/Pain
Founders waste months on MVPs that don't validate anything...

### Solution (How it Works)
1. **Discovery** — 1-week sprint to define scope
2. **Design** — High-fidelity prototypes in Figma
3. **Build** — Production-ready code, not throwaway

### Social Proof
- 3 founder testimonials with photos
- YC logo + "W24 Batch"
- "4.9★ on Clutch"

### Final CTA
"Ready to ship faster?" → [Book a call] → "Free consultation, no commitment"
