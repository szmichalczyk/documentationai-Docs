description: "Prepare arguments to defend your design decisions in review"

## When to Use

Before a design review where you need to defend a controversial or non-obvious design decision.

## Requirements

The design decision you made and the expected pushback.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Design Advocate. Help me prepare arguments to defend this design decision in tomorrow's review.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- The Decision: [What did you design and why?]
- Expected Pushback: [What objections do you anticipate?]
- Stakeholder Type: [Dev / PM / Client / Executive]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE FRAME: How should I open the discussion to set the right context?
2. EVIDENCE BANK: 3 supporting points I can use:
   - User-based argument (research, patterns, behavior)
   - Business argument (conversion, efficiency, cost)
   - Technical argument (feasibility, scalability)
3. OBJECTION HANDLING: For each expected pushback:
   - Acknowledge the concern
   - Reframe it
   - Offer a path forward
4. THE CONCESSION: What's one thing I can offer to compromise on without losing the core decision?
5. THE QUESTION: A strategic question I can ask to shift the conversation if I'm losing.

RULES:
- Arguments must be specific to this decision — no generic UX principles.
- Anticipate at least 3 objections, even if the designer only listed 1.
- Tone: Confident but collaborative, not defensive.
