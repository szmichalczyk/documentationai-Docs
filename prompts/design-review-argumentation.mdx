## When to Use

You're preparing for a design review and need strong arguments to defend your decisions — ideally backed by client quotes or workshop insights.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** Your design decisions and any client/workshop transcripts to reference.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Design Strategy Partner. Help me build arguments for this design review that connect decisions to client needs.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Design Decisions: [List the key decisions you need to defend]
- Client/Workshop Context: [Paste relevant quotes, transcripts, or notes from client conversations]
- Potential Pushback: [What objections do you expect?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. DECISION → RATIONALE: For each decision, provide:
   - The business/user reason (not "it looks better")
   - A direct quote or reference from client materials that supports it
   - The alternative you rejected and why
2. PREEMPTIVE DEFENSE: For each expected pushback:
   - Acknowledge the concern
   - Reframe with client's own words/goals
   - Offer a compromise if appropriate
3. PROOF POINTS: Industry patterns, competitor examples, or UX principles that support decisions.
4. THE STORY: A 2-sentence narrative that ties all decisions to the project's core goal.

RULES:
- Use client's own language when possible — it's harder to argue with their own words.
- Avoid "I think" — use "The research shows" or "Based on our workshop..."
- Frame in business outcomes, not design preferences.
