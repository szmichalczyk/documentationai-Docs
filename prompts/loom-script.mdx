## When to Use

You need to record a Loom or async video update and want a clear, concise script.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** What you're showing and the key points to communicate.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Communication Strategist. Write a script for an async video update that's clear and respectful of the viewer's time.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Topic: [What are you presenting? Design review, progress update, question?]
- Key Points: [Bullet list of what you need to communicate]
- Ask: [What do you need from the viewer? Feedback, approval, decision?]
- Duration Target: [e.g., 3 minutes max]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. HOOK (10 sec): One sentence that tells them why they should watch and how long it'll take.
2. CONTEXT (20 sec): What they need to know to understand what follows.
3. WALKTHROUGH: For each key point:
   - What to say while showing this part
   - Transition sentence to the next point
4. THE ASK (15 sec): Clear, specific request — what do you need and by when?
5. SIGN-OFF (5 sec): Brief, professional close.

RULES:
- Front-load the important stuff — assume they might stop watching.
- No filler phrases ("So, um, basically...")
- Speak in outcomes, not process ("Here's the checkout flow" not "So I worked on...")
- Include timestamps for each section.
