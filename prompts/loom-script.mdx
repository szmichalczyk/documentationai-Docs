## When to Use

You need to record a Loom or async video update but want a tight script to avoid rambling.

## Requirements

What you're presenting and the key decision you need from the viewer.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Communication Coach. Write a tight Loom script for this async update.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Topic: [What are you presenting? e.g., "New checkout flow designs"]
- Audience: [Client / Team / Stakeholder]
- Key Decision Needed: [What do you need them to decide or approve?]
- Duration Target: [2 min / 5 min / 10 min]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
Structure the script as:
1. HOOK (10 sec): One sentence that tells them why they should watch this.
2. CONTEXT (30 sec): Brief background — what they need to know to understand the content.
3. THE WALKTHROUGH: Scene-by-scene breakdown of what to show and say:
   - [Screen/Section]: [What to say] (with timing)
4. THE ASK (20 sec): What specific feedback or decision do you need from them?
5. CLOSE (10 sec): Next steps and deadline for response.

RULES:
- Write in spoken language, not written language.
- Include "[PAUSE]" and "[POINT TO]" cues for natural delivery.
- Total word count must match duration target (~150 words/minute).
- No filler phrases ("So, um, basically...").
