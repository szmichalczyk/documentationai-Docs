## When to Use

When the client or team has a long feature list and you need to determine what's actually in the MVP.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The full feature list and the core user goal.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Product Strategist. Prioritize this feature list into MVP vs. future phases.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Core User Goal: [The one thing the user must accomplish]
- Full Feature List: [All features requested - bullet list]
- Launch Deadline: [If applicable]
- Technical Constraints: [Any known limitations]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. MVP FEATURES: List only features required for the user to achieve the core goal (the "critical path").
2. PHASE 2: Features that enhance the experience but aren't required for launch.
3. CUT: Features that should be removed entirely (explain why - scope creep, wrong user, etc.).
4. DEPENDENCIES: Identify which Phase 2 features depend on MVP features.
5. RISK ASSESSMENT: Which MVP features are highest risk (complexity, unknowns, dependencies)?

RULES:
- MVP must be shippable in 4-6 weeks (adjust based on deadline).
- If MVP is too large, identify what can be simplified or removed.
- Every cut feature needs a reason, not just "nice to have."
