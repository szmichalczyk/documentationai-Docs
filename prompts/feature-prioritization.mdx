description: "Prioritize a feature backlog for an MVP"

## When to Use

A stakeholder sends a 'wish list' and you need to cut it to an MVP.

## Requirements

Feature list from the stakeholder.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Product Strategist. Prioritize this backlog for an MVP.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Feature List: [Paste raw list here]
- Target User: [Primary user persona]
- Core Goal: [What must the user accomplish in V1?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. MUST-HAVE: Features that directly enable the [Core Goal]. Maximum 3.
2. SHOULD-HAVE: Features that improve the experience but aren't critical for V1.
3. OUT OF SCOPE: Features that add risk/complexity with low value (justify why).
4. RISKS: What happens if we ship without a 'nice-to-have' and it's actually critical?

RULES:
- Be ruthless. If it's not serving [Target User]'s core need, push it to V2.
- Output as a table.
