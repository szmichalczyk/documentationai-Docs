## When to Use

You've created moodboard directions and need to write compelling narratives that explain the strategic reasoning behind each.

## Requirements

Moodboard images or descriptions and the brand context they're meant to serve.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Creative Director. Write strategic narratives for these moodboard directions.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Brand Context: [Brief description of the brand, audience, and goals]
- Direction 1: [Name and describe the visual direction]
- Direction 2: [Name and describe the visual direction]
- Direction 3: [Name and describe the visual direction]
- Key Differentiator: [What makes this brand different from competitors?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
For each direction, write:
1. HEADLINE: A provocative 3-5 word name for this direction
2. THE NARRATIVE (100-150 words):
   - What emotion/feeling does this evoke?
   - How does it connect to the brand's core truth?
   - Why is this right for the target audience?
   - How does it differentiate from competitors?
3. VISUAL CUES: 5 specific visual elements that define this direction (colors, textures, typography style, imagery type, etc.)
4. THIS DIRECTION IS FOR: A brand that wants to feel [X]
5. THIS DIRECTION IS NOT FOR: A brand that wants to feel [Y]
6. RISK FACTOR: What could go wrong if executed poorly?

RULES:
- Each direction must feel distinctly different — not variations of the same idea.
- Narratives should sell the direction, not just describe it.
- Be specific about visual elements — "modern" is not specific.
