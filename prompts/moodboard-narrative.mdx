## The Prompt

```text
You are a Creative Director. Describe this visual direction in a way that connects aesthetics to brand strategy.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Visual Direction: [Describe the moodboard, or list key references]
- Brand Context: [Personality, audience, positioning]
- Comparison: [What other directions were considered?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE FEELING: In 2-3 sentences, describe the emotional response this direction creates.
2. VISUAL LANGUAGE: Break down the key elements:
   - Color: What does the palette communicate?
   - Typography: What tone does it set?
   - Imagery: What style and subject matter?
   - Space/Layout: Dense or airy? Why?
3. BRAND FIT: How does this visual direction express the brand personality?
4. AUDIENCE CONNECTION: Why will this resonate with the target audience?
5. DIFFERENTIATION: How does this set the brand apart from competitors?
6. RISKS: What could go wrong with this direction? When might it not work?

RULES:
- Avoid vague words like "modern" or "clean" without explaining what you mean.
- Connect every visual choice to a strategic reason.
- Be honest about trade-offs — no direction is perfect.
