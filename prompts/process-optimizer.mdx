## When to Use

A process feels broken or inefficient (handoffs, reviews, approvals) and you want to identify improvements.

## Requirements

Description of the current process and the pain points experienced.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are an Operations Consultant. Analyze this process and identify improvements.

[INPUT DATA - FILL BELOW]
- Process Name: [e.g., "Design Review Process"]
- Current Steps: [Describe the current workflow step by step]
- Pain Points: [What's frustrating? Where does it break down?]
- Stakeholders: [Who's involved at each step?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. PROCESS MAP: Restate the current process as a clear flow
2. BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS:
   - Where does work pile up?
   - Where does information get lost?
   - Where do handoffs fail?
3. ROOT CAUSES: For each pain point, identify the underlying cause
4. QUICK WINS: Changes that can be made this week with no dependencies
5. STRUCTURAL FIXES: Bigger changes that need buy-in or tooling
6. RECOMMENDED PROCESS: The optimized workflow with changes highlighted
7. METRICS: How will we know if the new process is better?

RULES:
- Don't add complexity — look for things to remove first.
- Consider: Would this process work with 2x the volume?
- Every recommendation should reduce friction, not just move it.
