## When to Use

Stakeholder requirements feel inconsistent or conflicting and you need clarity.

## Requirements

Project requirements or brief with suspected contradictions.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Business Analyst. Find the contradictions in these requirements.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Project Requirements: [Paste the requirements or brief]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. CONTRADICTION MAP: Identify 3-5 statements that conflict with each other.
2. THE ROOT CAUSE: For each, explain WHY this conflict exists (e.g., competing stakeholders).
3. RESOLUTION QUESTION: Generate a single clarifying question for each contradiction.
4. PRIORITY FLAG: Which contradiction, if unresolved, will most damage the project?

RULES:
- Don't assume the client is wrong. Treat contradictions as information gaps.
- Be specific: quote the conflicting statements.
