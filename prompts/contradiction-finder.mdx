## When to Use

When the client's brief or feedback contradicts earlier statements or technical reality.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** New feedback/request vs. Original project goals.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are an Agency Design Partner. I am sensing a contradiction in the client's current direction.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Original Direction: [What was agreed]
- New Request: [What changed]
- Technical/Time Constraint: [Budget or Dev limits]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. CONFLICT ANALYSIS: Explain exactly how the new request conflicts with the original goals.
2. SCOPE CREEP WARNING: Estimate the potential impact on timeline/quality.
3. STRATEGIC REFRAMING: Provide a response to the client that acknowledges the request but redirects them to the "Why" of the project.
4. ALTERNATIVE: Suggest a "Version 2" path to satisfy the request without breaking the MVP.

RULES:
- Be objective and firm. 
- Protect the project's integrity.
```

<Callout kind="warning">
  Document contradictions immediately — they're easier to address when fresh than when the client has "always remembered it that way."
