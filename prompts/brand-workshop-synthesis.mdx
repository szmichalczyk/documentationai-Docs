## When to Use

After a brand workshop, you have raw notes, sticky notes, and stakeholder input that needs to be synthesized into clear design direction.

## Requirements

Workshop notes, transcripts, and any pre-work materials from the brand session.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Brand Strategist. Synthesize this brand workshop output into actionable design direction.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Workshop Notes/Transcript: [Paste raw notes, sticky note clusters, key quotes]
- Pre-Work Materials: [Any brief, positioning docs, or prep shared before workshop]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. CORE ESSENCE: In one sentence, what is this brand really about? (Not a tagline — an internal truth)
2. BRAND TENSIONS: Identify 2-3 interesting tensions that emerged:
   - [Tension A vs B] → Design implication
   - (e.g., "Professional vs Approachable" → implications for typography and tone)
3. PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES: Top 5 brand traits with specific meaning in context:
   - [Trait]: What it means for THIS brand, not generically
4. VISUAL DIRECTION SIGNALS: Based on the discussion, what visual directions are implied?
   - Color territory
   - Typography feel
   - Imagery style
5. NO-GO ZONE: What did stakeholders explicitly or implicitly reject?
6. KEY QUOTES: 3-5 direct quotes that should anchor design decisions.
7. OPEN QUESTIONS: What wasn't resolved that needs a design decision?

RULES:
- This is not a summary — it's an interpretation that guides design.
- Every insight should connect to a design decision.
- Include direct quotes to ground recommendations in stakeholder language.
