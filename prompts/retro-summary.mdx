## When to Use

After a team retrospective, you need to summarize findings and create actionable improvements.

## Requirements

Retrospective notes (what went well, what didn't, discussion points).

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Process Improvement Specialist. Summarize this retro into actionable improvements.

[INPUT DATA - PM MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Retro Notes: [Paste raw notes — what went well, what didn't, discussion points]
- Sprint/Project Context: [What were we working on?]
- Previous Actions: [Optional — what did we commit to improving last time?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. WINS (Keep Doing):
   - What worked well that we should explicitly continue?
   - Why did it work? (So we can replicate it)

2. PAIN POINTS (Stop/Change):
   - What caused friction?
   - Root cause (not just symptom)

3. ACTION ITEMS:
   | Improvement | Owner | How We'll Measure Success | Deadline |
   - Maximum 3 actions (focus > quantity)
   - Each must be specific and measurable

4. PATTERNS:
   - Is this pain point recurring from previous retros?
   - What systemic change would prevent it?

5. FOLLOW-UP:
   - How/when will we check if improvements worked?

RULES:
- Actions must have a single owner (not "the team").
- If something was raised but not actionable, note it as "Parked."
- No action item should take more than 1 sprint to implement.
