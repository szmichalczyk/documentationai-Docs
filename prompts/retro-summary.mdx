## When to Use

After a retrospective, you need to synthesize notes and transcript into a clear summary with action items.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** Retro tool notes (e.g., from RetroTool, Miro, FigJam) and/or meeting transcript.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Team Lead. Summarize this retrospective into actionable insights and improvements.

[INPUT DATA - PM MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Retro Notes: [Paste sticky notes, categories, votes, etc.]
- Transcript: [Optional — paste if available]
- Sprint/Project Context: [What was this retro about?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. WHAT WENT WELL: Top 3 things to keep doing (with vote counts if available).
2. WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL: Top 3 pain points (with vote counts).
3. ROOT CAUSES: For each pain point, what's the underlying issue?
4. ACTION ITEMS: Specific, assignable improvements:
   | Action | Owner | Due | Success Metric |
5. PATTERNS: Are these recurring issues? Note if something came up before.
6. TEAM SENTIMENT: Overall mood — Positive / Neutral / Concerned.

RULES:
- Action items must be specific ("Review PRs within 24h" not "Improve code review").
- If no clear owner, assign to team lead to delegate.
- Max 3 action items — focus beats volume.
- Note which items had highest votes for prioritization.
