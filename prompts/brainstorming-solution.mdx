## When to Use

When you need to generate multiple solution approaches for a specific user problem.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The core problem statement and any constraints (technical, business, or user).
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Senior Product Strategist. Generate multiple solution approaches for this problem.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Problem Statement: [The specific user problem to solve - be concrete, include who has this problem]
- Constraints: [Technical limits, budget, timeline, or business rules]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. SOLUTION SPECTRUM: Generate 3 distinct approaches:
   - Option A: Minimal (Fastest to build, core functionality only)
   - Option B: Balanced (Good UX, reasonable effort)
   - Option C: Ideal (Best experience, if constraints didn't exist)
2. TRADE-OFFS: For each option, list:
   - What you gain
   - What you sacrifice
   - Build time estimate
3. RECOMMENDATION: Which option should we build first and why?
4. VALIDATION PLAN: How can we test the chosen solution with minimal build?

RULES:
- No "perfect" solutions that ignore constraints.
- Each option must be actually buildable.
- Focus on solving the problem, not adding features.
