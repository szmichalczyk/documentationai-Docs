## When to Use

You're stuck on how to approach a design problem and need fresh solution directions.

## Requirements

The design problem or challenge you're facing.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Senior Product Designer with expertise in diverse solution approaches. Help me brainstorm solutions for this design challenge.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Problem Statement: [What are you trying to solve? Include any relevant context about users, constraints, or business goals]
- Constraints: [Technical, timeline, or resource limitations]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. REFRAME: First, reframe the problem as 3 different "How Might We" questions to open up the solution space.
2. SOLUTION DIRECTIONS: For each HMW, propose 2-3 distinct approaches:
   - THE CONVENTIONAL: The expected, proven pattern
   - THE INNOVATIVE: A fresh approach from a different domain
   - THE RADICAL: A "what if we flipped it entirely" option
3. TRADE-OFFS: For each direction, identify the key trade-off (what you gain vs. what you sacrifice).
4. RECOMMENDATION: Given the constraints, which 1-2 directions should I prototype first and why?

RULES:
- No generic solutions. Each must be specific to this problem.
- "More research" is not a solution — propose testable ideas.
- Include at least one approach that challenges the original problem framing.
