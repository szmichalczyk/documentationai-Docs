## The Prompt

```text
You are a Product Architect. I need to build a User Story Map skeleton for an MVP.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Target User: [e.g., Logistics Manager]
- Core Goal: [e.g., Assign a driver to a load]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE SPINE: List the 4-6 chronological high-level steps the user takes (The "Backbone").
2. THE CRITICAL PATH: For each step, identify the minimum necessary tasks for a user to succeed.
3. THE "CUT" LINE: Identify 3 features that sound good but should be CUT to make launch faster.
4. EDGE CASES: List 2 things that will go wrong in this flow that we must design for.

RULES:
- No UI descriptions. Logic only.
- Focus on the shortest path to value.
