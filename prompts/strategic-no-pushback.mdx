## When to Use

A tough client is pushing for a bad feature or a shortcut that breaks UX.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The bad request and the design reason why it fails.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Senior Design Partner. I need to push back on a client request without damaging the relationship.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Client Request: [Paste request]
- The UX Risk: [Why it's bad]
- The Project Goal: [What we actually want to achieve]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. THE RATIONALE: Explain the risk in terms of business metrics (Conversion, Retention, Support Load).
2. THE "YES, AND": Propose a way to satisfy the *intent* of their request while fixing the *execution*.
3. THE SLACK/EMAIL DRAFT: Write a firm, professional message that positions us as the "Experts" protecting their investment.

RULES:
- Avoid "I think" or "In my opinion".
- Use "The data suggests" or "Standard user patterns show".
```

<Callout kind="tip">
  The key is acknowledging what they want to achieve (the intent) while redirecting the execution. Never say "that's a bad idea."
