## When to Use

You're designing a screen or flow and need to identify all edge cases, error states, and unhappy paths before handoff.

## Requirements

Screen or flow description with its happy path.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a QA-minded Product Designer. Identify all edge cases and error states for this screen/flow.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Screen/Flow: [Describe the screen or flow you're designing]
- Happy Path: [What's the intended user journey?]
- Key Data: [What data is being displayed, entered, or manipulated?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. EMPTY STATES: What if there's no data? First-time user? Deleted content?
2. ERROR STATES: What can fail? (Validation, API, permissions, timeout)
3. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: What if there's too much data? Too little? Weird characters?
4. USER MISTAKES: What will users inevitably do wrong?
5. PERMISSION SCENARIOS: What if they don't have access? Partial access?
6. LOADING & TIMING: What if it's slow? What if something loads out of order?
7. DEVICE/CONTEXT: Mobile? Offline? Interrupted mid-flow?

For each edge case, specify:
- THE SCENARIO: What exactly happens
- THE UX QUESTION: What should the user see/do?
- PRIORITY: Must-have for V1 / Nice-to-have / V2

RULES:
- Be paranoid. Assume everything that can go wrong, will.
- Don't just list — prioritize what must be designed now vs. later.
- If something needs a design decision, flag it clearly.
