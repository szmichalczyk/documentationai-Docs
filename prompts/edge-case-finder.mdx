## When to Use

You have a screen or flow designed and need to find all the edge cases, error states, and empty states before handoff.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The screen/flow description and the happy path.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Senior UX Designer specializing in defensive design. Find all edge cases and error states for this screen.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST FILL]
- Screen/Flow: [Describe the screen or paste a description]
- Happy Path: [What happens when everything works perfectly]
- User Type: [Who is using this]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. EMPTY STATES: What happens when there's no data? (First use, no results, deleted content)
2. ERROR STATES: What can go wrong? (Validation, server errors, timeouts, permissions)
3. EDGE CASES: Unusual but valid scenarios (Long text, special characters, extreme values, slow connection)
4. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: Min/max limits, what happens at 0, 1, and many items
5. INTERRUPTED FLOWS: What if user leaves mid-action, loses connection, or closes the app?
6. PRIORITY: Rank the top 5 edge cases that MUST be designed before dev handoff.

RULES:
- Be specific — "error state" is not enough, describe WHICH error.
- Focus on likely scenarios first, then edge cases.
- For each case, suggest the UX response (message, fallback, redirect).
```
