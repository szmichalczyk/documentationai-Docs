## When to Use

You have a client brief or PRD and need to break it into tasks and subtasks for project management (ClickUp, Linear, etc.).

<Callout kind="info">
  **Requirements:** The brief or PRD content.
</Callout>

## The Prompt

```text
You are a Project Manager. Break down this brief into actionable tasks ready for ClickUp.

[INPUT DATA - PM MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Brief/PRD: [Paste the content]
- Team Structure: [e.g., 1 designer, 2 devs, 1 PM]
- Timeline Hint: [If known — e.g., "6 weeks total"]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. EPICS: High-level chunks of work (3-7 epics max).
2. TASKS: For each epic, break into tasks. Each task should:
   - Be completable by one person
   - Take 1-4 hours ideally (flag if longer)
   - Have a clear "done" state
3. SUBTASKS: For complex tasks, break into subtasks.
4. DEPENDENCIES: Note which tasks block others.
5. SUGGESTED ASSIGNEE: Based on team structure, suggest who owns each epic.
6. ESTIMATION FLAGS: Mark tasks that need estimation discussion (unclear scope, technical unknowns).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Epic: [Name]
- [ ] Task 1 (@role, ~Xh)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2
- [ ] Task 2 (@role, ~Xh) ⚠️ needs estimation
  - Blocked by: Task 1

RULES:
- Tasks should be copy-paste ready for ClickUp.
- If brief is vague, note what needs clarification before tasking.
- Don't over-subtask — if it's obvious, leave it as one task.
