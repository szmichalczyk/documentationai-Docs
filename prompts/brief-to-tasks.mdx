## When to Use

You receive a project brief and need to quickly break it down into actionable design tasks with estimates.

## Requirements

The project brief or scope description.

## The Prompt

```text wrap
You are a Design Project Manager. Convert this brief into an actionable task breakdown.

[INPUT DATA - DESIGNER MUST PASTE BELOW]
- Brief/Scope: [Paste the project brief or scope description]
- Timeline: [If known — e.g., "2 weeks" or "MVP by March"]
- Team: [Who's working on this? Just you? Designer + dev?]

[STRICT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. PHASE BREAKDOWN: Split the project into logical phases:
   - Discovery
   - Design
   - Iteration
   - Handoff
   
2. TASK LIST: For each phase, list specific tasks:
   | Task | Deliverable | Estimate (hours) | Dependencies |
   
3. CRITICAL PATH: Which tasks are blocking others? What must happen first?

4. RISK TASKS: Which tasks have uncertain scope or might expand?

5. QUICK WINS: What can be done in the first 2 days to show progress?

6. MISSING INFO: What information do you need from the client before starting specific tasks?

RULES:
- Tasks should be specific and completable ("Design empty states for dashboard" not "Do dashboard").
- Estimates should be realistic — add buffer for feedback rounds.
- Flag any tasks that require client input or decision.
